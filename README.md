# WebDev
In this repository I am going to learn about WebDev. 

Today is 17/07/2023, 1:55 AM in Brazil.

In this Repository I will write down my development in WebDev.

Note that I am from Brazil, so my native language is portuguese. But I will write in English to train more this language that is universaly used in the Programming World.

30 minutes a day, 5 days per wekk = 150 minutes = 2 hours and 30 min per week of Web Dev. Don't know if it is a good estimative, but I need to start anyway.
